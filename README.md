# OpenPose for Unity (Using OpenCV)
Tried to implement OpenPose (only single person) in Unity. But it lags too much. On my PC, it is running at 4/5 fps.  But on Android, it is only 1 fps.

### Running Instruction:
This project uses OpenCV for unity package. So, import it from asset store first. (It is NOT free :p)
